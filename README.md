###<a name="geninfo"/> Background Information

####What does Code for Denver typically do?

Generally speaking, we work with nonprofits or local government in three month blocks, building apps or websites that serve their needs. Who we work with and what issues we address are determined at our annual CodeAcross Denver event, scheduled at the beginning of the year. To stay on top of the things throughout the year, we host regular meetups (weekly and bi-weekly) to manage things and work on current projects.


####To what degree is your work influenced by Code for America?

Though we are part of Code for Americas Brigade, Code for Denver is more of an independent and locally-focused organization. As such, we are not given any guidelines to follow regarding how we operate or the like, but we do receive some sponsorship from Code for America.

####So how do I get involved?

Start by joining our Meetup.com group at www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver. This is where we list all of our upcoming meetings and events. Planning meetings are weekly (when in season) and hack nights are bi-weekly. RSVP or just drop by and say hello.

####How many people are working on a project at any given time?

This varies according the circumstances and there are no hard and fast rules that set a minimum or maximum number of volunteers per project. For the sake of efficiency, our broader goal is to focus the efforts of all volunteers on whatever project were currently working on.

####Is there any one person who is typically in charge of projects?

This also depends on the circumstances, though you can get a general sense by viewing the list of organizers at our [Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver/).


####Whats a hack night?

A hack night is an informal event where developers get together and work on a project.


####What tools do you use?

Our current workflow includes:

* General/team communication and chat: [Flowdock](http://www.flowdock.com)
* Version Control: [Git](http://git-scm.com/)/[Github](https://github.com/codefordenver)
* Story management: [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/)
* Documentation/Technical writing: [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B15HLk4_JV3nWjkyOGtFUmhKZDQ&usp=sharing_eid)

Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with any of these tools. Well help you get up and running.

For more info on getting started, see our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/codefordenver/org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

####Who can I contact for additional questions?

Get in touch with our organizers via our [Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver/) or drop us a line at codefordenver[at]gmail.com.

### <a name="noncoders"/>For Non-coders

####I'm not a programmer or I'm not interested in programming. Can I still get involved?

Yes! As long as you are willing to collaborate and engage there are numerous ways in which to be involved. As you can tell from our name, coding is a big part of what we do. But helping solve challenges in the community takes more than software expertise. Our brigade volunteers also have backgrounds in marketing, design, sales, facilitation, nonprofits, project management, and more. Additional perspectives and experiences are always valued and welcome, so come on down!

#### Where do we keep project docs, and how do we collaborate?

See our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/codefordenver/org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

####Ugh! There are too many languages and resources to choose from! Where is the best place to start?

We suggest Codecademy or CodeSchool. Both start with the basics, have plenty of free courses, and can be completed entirely in your browser.

As far as languages are concerned, HTML/CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python great languages to start with. All are in widespread use, cross-platform (used on/in multiple devices and environments), and are supported by plenty of documentation.

####What languages / frameworks do you typically use?

We don't use one particular language or framework all of the time. What we use depends on the nature of the project and the groups that we serve.
